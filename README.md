# Dijkstras-algorithm
Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path

# Steps to run
- Compile ShortestPath.java
- Make sure topo.txt is in the same directory as ShortestPath.java
- one the command java ShortestPath is run, you will be given a prompt that asks how many routers. 
- for the default topo.txt file enter 6
- you are then returned finding N', Y', Vector D, and Vector P for each iteration it goes through.
- At the end you are given the Forwarding Table with each Destination and its corresponding Line.
